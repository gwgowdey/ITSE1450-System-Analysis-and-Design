        The official API documentation would be created once the website is finalized. Since this is a class project
        and just the code "scaffolding" is completed, the documentation would be tough to create. However, I will include
        as much information and resources here as possible. A web scraper can also be used for the public portion of the website.
        The source code is publicly available as well.
