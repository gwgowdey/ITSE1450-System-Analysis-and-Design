    <p>This page would depend on the preferences of the organization. Overall, it is meant to expedite the recruiting process.</p>
    <p>Using one of the HR/recruitment apps would be preferable, but an in-house proprietary software solution can be created as well.</p>

    <p>Here is the section I wrote about it from my original proposal with some updates included:</p>

    <p>
        "Recruitment Login would be for any amateur player that is interested in joining the TCC Baseball program. This section would be based on the numerous 
        job applicant tracking systems such as (workday.com/en-us/products/talent-management/talent-acquisition.html), (greenhouse.io), and (ultimatesoftware.com/UltiPro-Solution-Features). 
        A potential recruit would pick their graduation year and fill out a questionnaire. This application would allow them to attach any documents or links for 
        skill level showcasing. The main goal here is to have one place to track recruits by their graduation year and be able to send automated messages to notify 
        them whether TCC Baseball is interested or not. Like the job application process, the TCC recruiting personnel would be able to move recruits/applicants to the 
        next round of the interview process, deny them, or accept them. Letter of intent and all supporting documents would be sent to the recruit once they have been accepted. 
        This helps prevent clutter, scheduling difficulties, and is more efficient than the typical “if interested in joining our program, then send email to....” method 
        where the emails and replies can be overwhelming. This is especially true if one works for a popular baseball program. Overall, the majority of the response process that 
        is so time consuming in recruitment would be automated and more organized."
